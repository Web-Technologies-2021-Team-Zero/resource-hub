### Getting Started - For team members
#### Step 1 
On your machine, create a local copy of this repository by cloning via GitHub Desktop or GitHub CLI or Git in VSCode. 

#### Step 2 
Create a branch on the <code>master</code> repository. Make all changes in your branch and commit to your branch of the repository. 
To create a branch use the command <code> git branch branch-name </code> and to make switch to your branch use the command 
<code>git checkout branch-name</code>

#### Step 3 
Ensure you are editing on your branch always, not always on the main repository. 
Run the command <code> git branch </code> to ensure this and checkout to your branch if on the master branch. 

#### Step 4 
When done with changes, create a pull request on the main repository online. Discuss your edits with a team member or two and then merge 
the branches. 

#### Step 5 
Continue making changes on your own branch, redoing steps 3 and 4 as you go.
